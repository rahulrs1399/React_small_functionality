        question : "Accordion as an instrument",
        answer: "It is a wind instrument, comprising two reed organs that are connected by folding bellows. Like the piano, the accordion hosts a keyboard to frame the melodies of the tunes. The sounds are produced by compressing and expanding the bellows - a mechanism that pumps air to the reed organs."

        question : "How do you make an accordion component?",
        answer: "Let's start by declaring an Accordion component, and use React's useState hook to manage its isExpanded state. Set the default state to false, as we want the component not to expand initially. For now, the component is not returning anything"
